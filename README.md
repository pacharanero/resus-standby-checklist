# Resus Standby Checklist

- A checklist I wrote in 2005 to help prepare the Resuscitation room for an incoming 'Pre-alert' or 'Standby' call.

- Some parts of it are probably quite out of date now, but the idea of having a checklist for perparations like this is not out of date, in fact it has gained momentum with programmes like the [WHO Pre-operative checklist](1) and popular books such as Atul Gawande's [The Checklist Manifesto](2)

- A Markdown version, which formats OK but is a nightmare to edit. Suggestions for ways to create Checklists neatly and elegantly in some form of Markdown or related form are welcomed.
